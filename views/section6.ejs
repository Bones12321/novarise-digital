    <h1><%= title %></h1>

    <p>
      We are two brothers bound not just by blood, but by a shared vision and relentless spirit. 
      One of us brings years of expertise in solar energy and electricity, the other, a triple major in Health Sciences with an honours degree. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Like many, we found ourselves caught in the endless loop of the 9 to 5 grind — working tirelessly, giving our all, yet receiving little reward. 
      The system seemed designed to keep us chasing, but never quite reaching, our true potential.
    </p>

    <p>
      So we made a choice: to break free. To escape the constraints and start our own system — one built on passion, freedom, and empowerment. 
      We created NovaRise Digital to share that escape with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is simple — to help you step out of the cycle, unlock your fullest potential, and build a life on your own terms. 
      Because the journey to freedom isn't just ours anymore — it's yours too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, we rise beyond the limits of the conventional, and forge a new path — one fueled by knowledge, resilience, and heart.
    </p>
